## Description

We were asked to create our personal professional portfolio that showcases our projects and provides contact details to help potential employers get the idea of who we are and what we do. We used HTML and CSS to build portfolio website from scratch.

## What did we do?

- Create a portfolio webpage from scratch using HTML and CSS
- Include the developer's name, a recent photo, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
- Create the navigation bar with links to the corresponding section
- Use flex boxes and media queries to create a responsive layout that adapts to different viewports
- Create projects section containing images that serve as clickable links that open projects in new tabs
- Highlight the importance of first project card by making the card image larger
- Format code using prettier
